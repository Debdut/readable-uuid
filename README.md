## Example

> _Loren Chariot Addy the Titbit of Cholame questioned Cele Garth Alda and 16 windy frogs_

```

MongoDB

```js
const id = require('uuid-readable')

readable_id: {
  'type': String,
  'default': id

_id: {
  'type': String,
  'default': id
}
```

## Use Cases

- Customer Support

You can remember parts of the id and that's enough to search it up and communicate throughout a large team. I will be using it as a secret generation for a service, and customer tickets.
